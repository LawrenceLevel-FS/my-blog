    "content": "Creating a next app and using JSON is simple and easy once you stop pulling your hair out. Hosting your app will be the next nightmare. 1. Create a new next app using 'npx create-next-app@latest'. 2. Make sure you set up a github repo to house your project as well as linking it to https:www.//netlify.com/. Finally, link your app to the json file using the './../method to link to the relative file path. From there you can treat it just like data you get from an API. It will come in as an array so no need to JSON.stringify the data coming. See my github repo for examples of how to achieve this result:'https://github.com/LawrenceLevel-FS/my-blog.git' .

    "author": "Level Lawrence",
    "date": "2024-07-14",
    "content": "Have you ever wondered how you could get your API up and running in the wild quickly? Try using Heroku! It’s a fast and simple way to get your API working and easy to maintain if you’re using GitHub. First, create a GitHub repository and initialize your project directory as a Git repository. Add your project files, commit them, and push them to GitHub using the commands git init, git add ., git commit -m 'Initial commit', git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>, and git push -u origin master. Next, navigate to the Heroku website and sign up or log in to your account. Once logged in, click on the 'New' button and select 'Create new app'. Give your app a unique name and choose your region. After creating your app, you will be directed to the app dashboard. Under the 'Deploy' tab, select 'GitHub' as the deployment method. Connect your GitHub account to Heroku, and then search for and select your repository. Make sure that your .env and node_modules directories are excluded from your repository by adding them to your .gitignore file. Ensure all necessary dependencies are listed in your package.json file, not as dev dependencies, to make sure they are available in the production environment. Once connected, you can enable automatic deploys for continuous deployment or manually deploy a specific branch.",
